This is example of the StrDiscr2 execution producing the Mg13 clusters classifications.

Run command (under Windows):  
StrDiscr2.exe


Input files:
StrDiscr2.inp         - main input file
*.sbas_               - cluster geometries generated by RUNNER global optimization
Structures-canonic.g6 - Canonic strings for the generated isomers. It was converted using the program labelg from the Structures-graphs.txt generated at previous run.
                        This file is needed only for similarity evaluation on the basis of graph isomorphism method.

Output files:
StrDiscr2.out         - main output file with classification results
Structures-*.xyz      - structures of unique clusters (structural classes) in various coordinate systems
Structures-graphs.g6  - non-canonic g6-strings needed for further graph isomorphism evaluation (to be converted to Structures-canonic.g6 using labelg external program)
